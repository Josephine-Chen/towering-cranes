# Postmortem

## What worked well?
1. Waffle.io worked well, but trello may be a more robust solution with better organization features.
2. Github rebase workflow was fine.

## What could have been better?
1. Mobile first development

## Why you should choose to take on our project
1. Gaining more experience with Angular and MySQL/Sequelize
2. Learning Materialize
3. A strong foundation of a product to iterate on

## Outstanding issues
1. Filters for Pokemon franchise specifically doesn't work
2. Mobile navbar is implemented in Jquery... should be done with a new angular controller for nav.
3. Refactor backend db to remove unused passwords field in Users table
4. Mobile support can be improved

## Ideas for improvement
1. Add Angular animations (perhaps for search bar?)
2. Allow users to view other users' collections
3. Embed videos in another tab inside modal window
4. More pages!
